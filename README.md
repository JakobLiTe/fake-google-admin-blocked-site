a fake Google: An Administrator has blocked this page


I was in an exam, using a mac, everyone else had chromebooks with a kind of exam mode, i scrambled something up in html and css so i could pass by the unassuming teacher that i also had a exam mode, worked perfectly.

Please edit the code to make it better, or just not. I dont plan on using it again
