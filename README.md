> A fake “This site is blocked by your administrator” page, built in plain HTML and CSS.

## About

This started as a quick UI clone of a very familiar managed‑device error screen.  
The goal was to recreate the look and feel of those pages using simple frontend techniques.

If you’ve ever used a managed device, you’ve probably seen a page like this.  
Recreating it turns out to be easier than people think — which is kind of the point.

## Notes

- No JavaScript
- No backend
- No functionality beyond visual display

Just markup and styling.

---

## Usage

Clone the repository and open the page locally:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/JakobLiTe/fake-google-admin-blocked-site.git fake_google_blocked && cd fake_google_blocked
 ```

and just run index.html

## What this is

- A static UI mockup  
- A frontend practice project  
- A visual clone for learning purposes  

## What this isn’t

- A real Google / Chrome page  
- A bypass for restrictions  
- Connected to any admin, browser, or device policy  

It’s literally just an HTML file you open in a browser.
