# fake-google-admin-blocked-site

A fake “This site is blocked by your administrator” page, built in plain HTML and CSS.

This started as a quick UI clone of a very familiar managed‑device error screen. The goal was to recreate the look and feel of those pages as closely as possible using simple frontend techniques.

# Notes

If you’ve ever used a managed device, you’ve probably seen a page like this.
Recreating it turns out to be easier than people think which is kind of the point.

# Usage

Clone the repository and open the page locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/JakobLiTe/fake-google-admin-blocked-site.git
cd fake-google-admin-blocked-site
```
Open index.html. That’s it.

# What this is (and isn’t)his is:
This is a
  •	A static UI mockup	A frontend practice project
	•	A visual clone for learning purposes

This is not:
	•	A real Google / Chrome page
	•	A bypass for restrictions
	•	Connected to any admin, browser, or device policy

It’s literally just an HTML file you open in a browser.
